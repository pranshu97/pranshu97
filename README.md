<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Pranshu </h1>
<h3 align="left">Iâ€™m an Applied Scientist with ~5 years of experience building scalable and intelligent AI/ML solutions across Search, Multimedia, Medical Imaging, and Surveillance domains. My expertise lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, NLP, Audio Processing, Generative AI, and Multimodal Machine Learning.
<br> <br>

At Microsoft Bing, I lead initiatives in Responsible AI, including classifier development, adversarial evaluation, and automation pipelines â€” working at search engine scale with 100B+ queries, ensuring ethical and robust AI deployment. Previously at Amazon Prime Video, I worked on metadata generation, music and apparel detection in videos, and multimodal models powering product discovery â€” delivering automation that impacted 10B+ streams.
<br> <br>

Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems using LLMs, Transformers (ViT, Swin), CLIP, and diffusion models, while ensuring responsible and scalable deployment. Iâ€™ve published impactful research (Springer, Amazon ML Conf) and filed a patent on AI content moderation frameworks.
<br> <br>

ðŸ“Œ Currently open to Applied Scientist / ML Scientist / Research Engineer opportunities in the UK, especially roles focused on multimodal learning, GenAI, or AI for content understanding.
